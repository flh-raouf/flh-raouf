1.  In your forked repo, go to the `Settings tab > actions > general`. In the `Workflow permissions` section, toggle `Read and Write permissions` and press `save`. This will allow for the snake contributions svg to be generated based on your own contributions via Github Actions.
2.  Go to the `Actions` tab, select `Generate Snake` and click `run workflow`. That way, you will manually generate your first snake svg; after that, a new one will be generated every 12 hours.
